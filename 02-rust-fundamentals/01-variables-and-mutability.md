## What is a Variable?

A variable is a **named storage location** in your computer's memory. Think of it as a labeled box:

```
┌─────────┐
│   42    │  ← The value stored inside
└─────────┘
    x        ← The label (variable name)
```

When you create a variable, three things happen:

1. **Memory is reserved** — space is set aside to hold the value
2. **The value is stored** — the data is written into that memory
3. **The name is bound** — the name `x` is associated with that memory location

### The History of Variables in Programming

The concept of a "variable" goes back to **mathematics** — where x in an equation represents an unknown value. When programming languages were first invented in the 1950s (Fortran, LISP), they borrowed this terminology.

But computer variables are fundamentally different from mathematical variables:
- In math, $x = 5$ is a **declaration of truth** — $x$ IS 5, forever
- In programming (most languages), `x = 5` is an **instruction** — "store 5 at the location called x"

Rust actually brings things closer to the mathematical meaning: `let x = 5` creates an **immutable binding** — x IS 5 for the rest of its scope, just like in math. You need `let mut` to opt into the imperative "store and change" behavior. This is influenced by **functional programming** languages like Haskell and ML, where all bindings are immutable by default.

### How Different Languages Handle Variables

| Language | Syntax | Default | Type System |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Rust** | `let x = 5;` | Immutable | Static, inferred |
| **C** | `int x = 5;` | Mutable | Static, explicit |
| **Python** | `x = 5` | Mutable | Dynamic |
| **JavaScript** | `let x = 5` / `const x = 5` | Depends on keyword | Dynamic |
| **Haskell** | `let x = 5` | Immutable (always!) | Static, inferred |
| **Go** | `x := 5` | Mutable | Static, inferred |

Rust and Haskell are the only mainstream languages where immutability is the default. This single design decision prevents entire categories of bugs.

## Creating Variables with `let`

In Rust, you create variables using the `let` keyword:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Output:
```
The value of x is: 5
```

### Breaking It Down

```
let x = 5;
│   │   │ │
│   │   │ └── Semicolon: this statement is complete
│   │   └──── The value we're storing (an integer literal)
│   │  
│   └──────── The variable name (also called a "binding")
└──────────── The keyword that creates a variable
```

### What Does "Binding" Mean?

In Rust, we say `let x = 5` **binds** the name `x` to the value `5`. This is more than pedantic — in Rust, `let` doesn't just declare a variable, it creates a *binding* between a name and a value. The distinction becomes important when we learn about ownership in Stage 3.

```
"x is bound to 5"    ← Rust terminology
"x contains 5"       ← Also fine for now
"x equals 5"         ← Casual, works for beginners
```

### Creating Multiple Variables

```rust
fn main() {
    let name = "Alice";
    let age = 30;
    let height = 5.6;
    let is_student = false;
    
    println!("{} is {} years old", name, age);
    println!("Height: {} feet, Student: {}", height, is_student);
}
```

Output:
```
Alice is 30 years old
Height: 5.6 feet, Student: false
```

### Variable Naming Rules

Rust variable names must follow these rules:

| Rule | Example (Valid) | Example (Invalid) |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Must start with a letter or underscore | `age`, `_temp` | `1name`, `@data` |
| Can contain letters, digits, underscores | `user_name`, `count2` | `user-name`, `my.var` |
| Must use **snake_case** (convention) | `first_name`, `total_count` | `firstName`, `TotalCount` |
| Cannot use reserved keywords | `my_let`, `my_fn` | `let`, `fn`, `struct` |
| Case-sensitive | `name` ≠ `Name` ≠ `NAME` | — |

```rust
// GOOD — snake_case is the Rust convention
let first_name = "Alice";
let total_count = 42;
let is_valid = true;
let _unused = 0;    // Underscore prefix = "I know this is unused"

// BAD — the compiler will warn you (but it still works)
let firstName = "Alice";    // ⚠️ Warning: should use snake_case
let TotalCount = 42;        // ⚠️ Warning: should use snake_case
```

> **Real-World Practice:** Rust enforces `snake_case` for variable and function names via a compiler warning. The entire Rust ecosystem follows this convention. If you're coming from Java or JavaScript (camelCase), this will take a few days to get used to.

## What Happens in Memory?

When you write `let x = 5;`, here's what happens on the **stack** (we'll explain stack vs heap in Stage 3):

```
Stack Memory (simplified):
┌───────────────┐
│ x = 5         │  ← 4 bytes reserved, value 5 stored
├───────────────┤
│ (next var)    │
├───────────────┤
│ ...           │
└───────────────┘
```

### How Much Memory?

Different types use different amounts of memory:

```rust
let a: i32 = 5;       // 4 bytes (32 bits)
let b: i64 = 5;       // 8 bytes (64 bits)
let c: bool = true;   // 1 byte
let d: char = 'A';    // 4 bytes (Unicode scalar value)
let e: f64 = 3.14;    // 8 bytes (64-bit float)
```

We'll cover all types in detail in Tutorials 3 and 4 of this stage.

### Deep Dive: The Stack — Where Your Variables Live

When we say `let x = 5` stores `x` on the **stack**, what IS the stack exactly?

The stack is a region of memory that your program gets automatically when it starts. Think of it like a **stack of plates** in a cafeteria:

- You can only add a plate to the **top** (push)
- You can only remove the **top** plate (pop)
- You can't pull a plate from the middle

```
Real-world analogy:

Cafeteria plate stack:
  ┌───────┐
  │ Plate │  ← You can only access this one (top)
  ├───────┤
  │ Plate │
  ├───────┤
  │ Plate │ 
  ├───────┤
  │ Plate │  ← Can't reach this without removing the ones above
  └───────┘
```

In your computer:
- **Pushing** = creating a new variable (adding to the top)
- **Popping** = a variable going out of scope (removing from the top)
- The stack pointer (a CPU register called `RSP` on x86-64) tracks where the "top" is

```
// When this code runs:
fn main() {
    let a: i32 = 10;   // Push 4 bytes onto stack
    let b: i32 = 20;   // Push 4 more bytes
    let c: i32 = 30;   // Push 4 more bytes
}   // All three are popped when main() ends

Stack grows DOWNWARD in memory (on most architectures):

High address ─────────────────────────
              │                       │
              │   (previous data)     │
              ├───────────────────────┤ ← Stack pointer before main()
              │   a = 10  (4 bytes)   │
              ├───────────────────────┤
              │   b = 20  (4 bytes)   │
              ├───────────────────────┤
              │   c = 30  (4 bytes)   │
              ├───────────────────────┤ ← Stack pointer during main()
              │   (free space)        │
Low address  ─────────────────────────
```

The stack is incredibly fast because:
1. **No allocation overhead** — the CPU just moves the stack pointer (a single instruction)
2. **CPU cache friendly** — stack data is close together in memory, so the CPU cache hits are frequent
3. **Automatic cleanup** — when a function returns, all its stack data is "freed" by simply moving the stack pointer back

This is why Rust's `let` variables are so fast compared to heap-allocated data in languages like Java or Python, where every variable might trigger a garbage collector.

> **Historical Note:** The stack-based memory model dates back to the 1950s and the invention of the **call stack** by Friedrich L. Bauer and Klaus Samelson. It's one of the most fundamental concepts in computer science — every programming language uses it, even if they hide it from you.

## Type Inference — Rust Guesses the Type

Rust is a **statically typed** language — every variable has a type known at compile time. But you don't always have to write the type explicitly! Rust has **type inference**:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;          // Rust infers: i32 (32-bit integer)
    let y = 3.14;       // Rust infers: f64 (64-bit float)
    let z = true;       // Rust infers: bool
    let name = "Alice"; // Rust infers: &str (string slice)
    let c = 'A';        // Rust infers: char
}
```

### How Does Rust Know?

The compiler looks at:
1. **The value you assigned** — `5` is an integer, `3.14` is a float
2. **How you USE the variable later** — if you pass it to a function expecting `u8`, the compiler knows
3. **The default** — when ambiguous, integers default to `i32`, floats default to `f64`

### When Type Inference Fails

Sometimes Rust can't figure out the type and needs help:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ❌ This won't compile — Rust doesn't know which type of collection
    let numbers = Vec::new();  // Vec of what? i32? String? 
    
    // ✅ Fix: tell Rust the type
    let numbers: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();  // A vector of 32-bit integers
    
    // ✅ Or let Rust figure it out from usage:
    let mut numbers = Vec::new();
    numbers.push(5);  // Now Rust knows: Vec<i32> (because 5 is i32)
}
```

### What Does "Statically Typed" Mean?

```
Statically typed (Rust, C, Java, TypeScript):
  → Every variable's type is known at COMPILE time
  → Type mismatches are caught BEFORE the program runs
  → Once a variable has a type, it CANNOT change

Dynamically typed (Python, JavaScript, Ruby):
  → Types are checked at RUNTIME
  → Type errors appear when the code runs
  → A variable can hold any type at any time
```

```rust
// In Rust, a variable's type is FIXED
let x = 5;       // x is i32
// x = "hello";  // ❌ ERROR: can't assign a string to an i32 variable

// In Python, this would work fine:
// x = 5
// x = "hello"   # No error in Python!
```

---

## Type Annotations — Telling Rust the Type

You can explicitly tell Rust what type a variable should be:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;           // Explicit: x is a 32-bit integer
    let y: f64 = 3.14;        // Explicit: y is a 64-bit float
    let z: bool = true;       // Explicit: z is a boolean
    let name: &str = "Alice"; // Explicit: name is a string slice
    let c: char = 'A';        // Explicit: c is a character
}
```

### The Syntax

```
let variable_name: Type = value;
                 │
                 └── Colon followed by the type
```

### When Should You Write Type Annotations?

| Situation | Annotate? | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Type is obvious from the value | No | `let x = 5;` |
| Rust can't infer the type | Yes | `let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();` |
| You want a non-default type | Yes | `let x: u8 = 5;` (instead of default i32) |
| Function parameters | Always | `fn add(a: i32, b: i32)` |
| Function return types | Always | `fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32` |
| For clarity in complex code | Helpful | `let result: HashMap<String, Vec<i32>> = ...` |

> **Real-World Practice:** Most Rust developers omit type annotations when the type is obvious, and add them when it improves readability. The rust-analyzer IDE extension shows you the inferred types inline, so you always know what type a variable has.

## Immutability by Default

Here's the big one. **Variables in Rust are immutable by default:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("x is {}", x);
    
    x = 6;  // ❌ ERROR!
    println!("x is {}", x);
}
```

Compiler error:
```
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - first assignment to `x`
3 |     println!("x is {}", x);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
  |
help: consider making this binding mutable
  |
2 |     let mut x = 5;
  |         +++
```

Notice how the compiler:
1. Tells you WHAT went wrong: "cannot assign twice to immutable variable"
2. Shows you WHERE both assignments happen
3. Suggests HOW to fix it: "consider making this binding mutable: `let mut x`"

### What Does "Immutable" Mean?

```
Immutable = Cannot be changed after creation
Mutable   = Can be changed after creation
```

```
Analogy:

Immutable is like writing with a permanent marker on a whiteboard:
  → You wrote "5" and you CAN'T erase it (without creating a new section)

Mutable is like writing with a dry-erase marker:
  → You wrote "5" and you CAN erase it and write "6"
```

---

## Making Variables Mutable with `mut`

To make a variable changeable, add the `mut` keyword:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;    // ← mut makes it mutable
    println!("x is {}", x);
    
    x = 6;            // ✅ This works now!
    println!("x is {}", x);
    
    x = 7;            // ✅ Can change as many times as you want
    println!("x is {}", x);
}
```

Output:
```
x is 5
x is 6
x is 7
```

### You Can Only Change the Value, Not the Type

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;      // x is i32
    x = 10;             // ✅ Fine — still an i32
    // x = "hello";     // ❌ ERROR — can't change from i32 to &str
}
```

Even with `mut`, the **type is fixed** once the variable is created. You can change the value, but not the type.

### When to Use `mut`

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Counters | `let mut count = 0; count += 1;` |
| Accumulators | `let mut sum = 0; for n in numbers { sum += n; }` |
| Buffers | `let mut buffer = String::new(); buffer.push_str("hello");` |
| State that changes | `let mut is_running = true; is_running = false;` |
| Loop variables | `let mut i = 0; while i < 10 { i += 1; }` |

> **Rule of thumb:** Start with `let` (immutable). Only add `mut` when you actually need to change the value. The compiler will tell you if you need `mut` — just follow its suggestions.

---

## Why Immutable by Default?

This is a design decision that confuses people from other languages. Why make variables immutable by default?

### Reason 1: Prevents Accidental Changes

```rust
fn main() {
    let tax_rate = 0.08;     // 8% tax rate
    // ... 200 lines of code ...
    // tax_rate = 0.50;      // ❌ Oops! Would make tax 50%. Compiler catches this.
    
    let total = price * (1.0 + tax_rate);
}
```

Without immutability, you might accidentally change a value somewhere deep in your code and spend hours debugging why your calculations are wrong.

### Reason 2: Makes Code Easier to Understand

```rust
// When you see this:
let name = "Alice";
// ... 100 lines later ...
println!("{}", name);  // You KNOW it's still "Alice". Guaranteed.

// With mut:
let mut name = "Alice";
// ... 100 lines later ...
println!("{}", name);  // Could be anything! Someone might have changed it.
```

Immutability means you can **trust** that a value hasn't changed. Reading `let x = 5` means `x` is 5 *forever* in that scope.

### Reason 3: Enables Compiler Optimizations

When the compiler knows a value won't change, it can:
- Store it in a CPU register instead of memory (faster access)
- Inline the value wherever it's used
- Eliminate unnecessary loads from memory
- Enable auto-vectorization

### Reason 4: Thread Safety

Immutable data is **automatically safe to share across threads** (we'll cover this in Stage 12). If nothing can change a value, multiple threads can read it simultaneously with zero risk of data races.

### The Principle

> In Rust, mutability is an **explicit opt-in**. This means every `mut` in your code is a signal: "Pay attention — this value WILL change." This makes it much easier to understand data flow in complex programs.

### How Other Languages Handle Mutability

Rust's "immutable by default" is rare. Let's see how other languages compare:

**C/C++:** Everything is mutable by default. You use `const` to opt into immutability:
```c
int x = 5;        // Mutable by default
x = 10;           // Allowed
const int y = 5;  // Must explicitly say "const"
y = 10;           // Compile error
```

**Java:** Variables are mutable by default. `final` makes them immutable:
```java
int x = 5;            // Mutable
final int y = 5;      // Immutable
```
But Java's `final` only prevents reassignment — if the variable holds an object, the object's internals can still change! This is a common source of bugs.

**JavaScript:** Has three keywords with different mutability rules:
```javascript
var x = 5;    // Mutable, function-scoped (legacy, avoid)
let y = 5;    // Mutable, block-scoped
const z = 5;  // Immutable binding (but objects are still mutable inside!)
```

**Python:** Has NO immutability enforcement at all — it's purely convention:
```python
x = 5
x = 10  # Always works, no way to prevent this
MAX_SIZE = 100  # UPPERCASE = "please don't change this" (just convention)
```

**Haskell:** Everything is immutable. Always. There is no `mut`:
```haskell
let x = 5  -- x is 5 forever. Period.
-- There is no way to make x mutable in Haskell
-- To "change" something, you create a new value
```

Rust sits in a sweet spot: immutable by default (like Haskell), but you can opt into mutability when you need it (unlike Haskell, where you need monads for mutable state). This pragmatic approach is one reason Rust is more approachable than pure functional languages while still being safer than C/C++.

---

## Shadowing — Reusing a Variable Name

Here's a concept that's unique to Rust (well, some functional languages have it too). **Shadowing** is when you create a new variable with the same name as an existing one:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("x is {}", x);    // x is 5
    
    let x = x + 1;             // New "x" shadows the old "x"
    println!("x is {}", x);    // x is 6
    
    let x = x * 2;             // Shadows again
    println!("x is {}", x);    // x is 12
}
```

Output:
```
x is 5
x is 6
x is 12
```

### What's Happening?

Each `let x` creates a **brand new variable** that happens to have the same name. The old variable still exists in memory but is no longer accessible by name:

```
Step 1: let x = 5;
┌─────────┐
│ x₁ = 5  │  ← "x" refers to this
└─────────┘

Step 2: let x = x + 1;
┌─────────┐
│ x₁ = 5  │  ← Still exists, but hidden (shadowed)
├─────────┤
│ x₂ = 6  │  ← "x" now refers to this
└─────────┘

Step 3: let x = x * 2;
┌─────────┐
│ x₁ = 5  │  ← Hidden
├─────────┤
│ x₂ = 6  │  ← Hidden
├─────────┤
│ x₃ = 12 │  ← "x" now refers to this
└─────────┘
```

### Shadowing Can Change the Type!

This is a key difference from `mut` — shadowing creates a completely new variable, so it can have a different type:

```rust
fn main() {
    let spaces = "   ";         // &str (a string)
    let spaces = spaces.len();  // usize (a number) — DIFFERENT TYPE!
    println!("Number of spaces: {}", spaces);
}
```

This would NOT work with `mut`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut spaces = "   ";     // &str
    // spaces = spaces.len();   // ❌ ERROR: expected &str, got usize
}
```

### When is Shadowing Useful?

#### 1. Converting Types

```rust
fn main() {
    let input = "42";                            // User input: a string
    let input: i32 = input.parse().unwrap();     // Parse to integer, reuse name
    println!("Number: {}", input);               // 42
}
```

Without shadowing, you'd need two names: `input_str` and `input_num`. Shadowing keeps the name clean.

#### 2. Processing Data Step by Step

```rust
fn main() {
    let name = "  Alice  ";          // Raw input
    let name = name.trim();          // Remove whitespace: "Alice"
    let name = name.to_uppercase();  // Convert: "ALICE"
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

#### 3. Narrowing from Option

```rust
fn main() {
    let number: Option<i32> = Some(42);
    
    if let Some(number) = number {
        // "number" inside here is i32, not Option<i32>
        println!("The number is {}", number);
    }
}
```

## Shadowing vs mut — What's the Difference?

| Feature | `mut` | Shadowing |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Keyword | `let mut x = 5; x = 6;` | `let x = 5; let x = 6;` |
| Changes value? | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (new variable, same name) |
| Changes type? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Creates new variable? | ❌ No (same memory location) | ✅ Yes (new memory location) |
| Old value accessible? | ❌ Gone (overwritten) | ❌ Gone (shadowed, eventually freed) |
| Compile-time guarantee | Value is mutable | Each binding is still immutable |

### When to Use Which?

```rust
// USE MUT when you need to update the same variable repeatedly
let mut count = 0;
for _ in 0..10 {
    count += 1;  // Modifying the same variable
}

// USE SHADOWING when you're transforming a value into something new
let input = "42";
let input: i32 = input.parse().unwrap();  // Different type, same name
```

---

## Variable Scope — Where Variables Live

A **scope** is a region of code where a variable is valid. In Rust, scope is defined by curly braces `{}`:

```rust
fn main() {                     // ─── main scope starts
    let x = 5;                  // x is valid from here...
    
    {                           // ─── inner scope starts
        let y = 10;             // y is valid from here...
        println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);  // ✅ Both accessible
    }                           // ─── inner scope ends. y is DROPPED here.
    
    println!("x: {}", x);      // ✅ x is still valid
    // println!("y: {}", y);   // ❌ ERROR: y is no longer valid!
}                               // ─── main scope ends. x is DROPPED here.
```

### Visualizing Scope

```
fn main() {
│
│   let x = 5;          ← x comes into existence
│   │
│   │   {
│   │   │
│   │   │   let y = 10; ← y comes into existence
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   │            ← x AND y are both valid here
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   ▼            ← y is DROPPED (destroyed) here
│   │   }
│   │
│   │                    ← only x is valid here
│   │
│   ▼                    ← x is DROPPED here
}
```

### What Does "Dropped" Mean?

When a variable goes out of scope (its `}` is reached), Rust **drops** it — meaning:
1. Any cleanup code runs (the `Drop` trait — we'll learn about this in Stage 11)
2. The memory is freed
3. The variable name is no longer valid

This is how Rust manages memory without a garbage collector. **Scope = lifetime**. When the scope ends, the memory is freed. Always. Automatically.

### How Other Languages Handle Cleanup

Rust's scope-based cleanup is called **RAII** (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) — a pattern borrowed from C++. Here's how different languages handle the same problem:

**C:** You must manually free memory. Forget, and you have a memory leak:
```c
char* buffer = malloc(1024);  // Allocate
// ... use buffer ...
free(buffer);                  // Must remember this!
// If you forget → memory leak
// If you free twice → undefined behavior (crash or security vulnerability)
```

**Java/Python/JavaScript:** A garbage collector periodically finds and frees unused memory:
```python
buffer = create_buffer()  # Allocated
# ... use buffer ...
# When buffer is no longer referenced, the garbage collector
# will EVENTUALLY free it — but you don't know when!
```

**Rust:** Memory is freed deterministically when the scope ends:
```rust
{
    let buffer = String::from("hello");  // Allocated
    // ... use buffer ...
}  // buffer is freed RIGHT HERE, immediately, guaranteed
```

Rust's approach combines the best of both worlds:
- **Deterministic** like C (you know exactly when memory is freed)
- **Automatic** like garbage-collected languages (you can't forget)
- **No garbage collector overhead** (no periodic pauses to scan memory)

> **Deep Insight:** This is why Rust can match C's performance while being memory-safe. The secret is that Rust moves the "when to free memory" decision from runtime (garbage collector) to compile time (scope analysis). The compiler inserts the cleanup code for you during compilation, so there's zero runtime cost.

### Shadowing and Scope

Shadowing creates a new variable in the current scope:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;           // x₁ starts
    let x = 10;          // x₂ starts, x₁ is shadowed
    
    {
        let x = 20;      // x₃ starts (only in this inner scope)
        println!("{}", x); // 20 (x₃)
    }                     // x₃ is dropped
    
    println!("{}", x);   // 10 (back to x₂!)
}
```

## Unused Variables

Rust warns you about variables you create but never use:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;  // ⚠️ Warning: unused variable `x`
}
```

```
warning: unused variable: `x`
 --> src/main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         ^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_x`
```

### How to Silence the Warning

#### Method 1: Prefix with underscore

```rust
fn main() {
    let _x = 5;  // No warning — underscore means "I know this is unused"
}
```

#### Method 2: Just an underscore (discard the value)

```rust
fn main() {
    let _ = calculate_something();  // Discard the result entirely
}
```

#### Method 3: Use the variable!

The best fix is usually to actually use the variable or remove it if it's not needed.

> **Real-World Practice:** Unused variable warnings help keep your code clean. During development, prefix with `_` to temporarily silence warnings. Before committing code, remove any truly unused variables.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Forgetting `mut`

```rust
fn main() {
    let count = 0;
    count += 1;  // ❌ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
}
// Fix: let mut count = 0;
```

### Mistake 2: Using a Variable Before Assigning

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32;
    println!("{}", x);  // ❌ use of possibly-uninitialized variable
}
```

Rust does NOT give variables a default value (unlike some languages). You MUST initialize before using:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32;
    x = 5;              // ✅ Assign before use
    println!("{}", x);  // ✅ Now it's fine
}
```

### Mistake 3: Trying to Change the Type with `mut`

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    x = "hello";  // ❌ expected integer, found `&str`
}
// Fix: use shadowing instead: let x = "hello";
```

### Mistake 4: Using camelCase Instead of snake_case

```rust
fn main() {
    let myVariable = 5;  // ⚠️ Warning: should be my_variable
    let firstName = "Alice";  // ⚠️ Warning: should be first_name
}
```

This isn't an error (the code compiles), but the compiler warns you because the Rust convention is `snake_case`.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Variables

Create variables for your personal info and print them:

```
Name: [your name]
Age: [your age]
Height: [your height in meters]
Is student: [true or false]
Favorite character: [a single character]
```

### Exercise 2: Mutability

Create a mutable counter that starts at 0. Increment it three times, printing after each increment:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
```

### Exercise 3: Shadowing Chain

Start with the string `"42"`, shadow it to parse into a number, then shadow it again to double it:

```rust
let value = "42";
// Your code here — use shadowing to convert and double
// Final print should show: 84
```

### Exercise 4: Scope Experiment

Predict the output of this code, then run it to check:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    {
        let x = 2;
        {
            let x = 3;
            println!("A: {}", x);
        }
        println!("B: {}", x);
    }
    println!("C: {}", x);
}
```

### Exercise 5: Fix the Errors

Fix each of these programs (they all have exactly one error):

```rust
// Program 1
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    x = 10;
    println!("{}", x);
}

// Program 2
fn main() {
    let y: i32;
    println!("{}", y);
}

// Program 3
fn main() {
    let mut z = "hello";
    z = 42;
    println!("{}", z);
}
```

## Summary

| Concept | Syntax | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Create variable** | `let x = 5;` | Immutable by default |
| **Mutable variable** | `let mut x = 5;` | Can change value (not type) |
| **Type annotation** | `let x: i32 = 5;` | Explicitly specify the type |
| **Type inference** | `let x = 5;` | Compiler figures out the type |
| **Shadowing** | `let x = 5; let x = 10;` | New variable, same name (can change type) |
| **Scope** | `{ let x = 5; }` | Variable lives until `}` |
| **Unused var** | `let _x = 5;` | Underscore prefix silences warnings |

### Key Takeaways

1. **`let` creates an immutable binding** — you can't change it
2. **`let mut` creates a mutable binding** — you can change the value (not the type)
3. **Shadowing** creates a brand new variable with the same name (CAN change type)
4. **Scope** determines how long a variable lives — ends at `}`
5. **Rust never gives default values** — you must initialize before use
6. **Immutability by default** prevents bugs and enables optimizations
